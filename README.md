Laboratory 1 and 2 work for Industrial Informatics **@UTCN**\
**Laboratory 1:**\
**Exercise 1**: Determine and display the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence. (F0 = 0, F1 = 1, then use the recursive formula Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2).\
**Exercise 2**: Read two real numbers from the keyboard and then, using the binary operators +, -, *, /, perform some calculations. Create a class containing methods for mathematical operations as well as a method for display.\
**Exercise 3**: Create an application that converts temperatures from ℃ to ℉ and from ℉ to ℃, using the formulas 𝑭=𝑪∙𝟗/𝟓+𝟑𝟐, 𝑪=(𝑭−𝟑𝟐)∙𝟓/𝟗. The application must contain two methods, and the values are to be entered from the keyboard.\
**Exercise 4**: Calculate the ideal weight (kg) based on height (cm), age (years), and gender (f or m). Create a new class containing three methods: two for calculating weight and one for displaying the ideal weight using the formulas below. Parameters are read from the keyboard.\
**Exercise 5**: Enter a string of integers from the keyboard and calculate the geometric and arithmetic mean of the numbers.\

**Laboratory2:**\
**Exercise 1**: I've created a Windows Form project that includes a login (a username and a password read from a file), and upon pressing a button, a new form opens. The second form contains a label "Hello username" and an Exit button.\
**Exercise 2**: I've created a Windows Form project according to the figure below. The first listBox reads objects from a file, and then the selected objects are copied to the second listBox. The Delete button allows deleting objects from the second listBox.\
**Exercise 3**: I've created a calculator that contains three textBoxes (two of them are used for entering numbers, and the third one is for displaying the result) and a menu (MenuStrip) that contains binary operators.\
**Exercise 4**: I've created a form that contains a TabControl with two pages. The first page contains a list of different items (e.g., car names, city names, etc.). When an item is selected, a specific image related to the selected name will appear in the form. The second page has two radioButton groups. Select one radioButton from the first group and one from the second group and print the result in a MessageBox.\
